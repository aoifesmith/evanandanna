            <p>We are so excited for our wedding day and hope you can be a part of it too. We wanted to provide
                information so as to help make organising the weekend as easy as possible. We have put together details
                we have taken the time to research so you don’t have to. We are hosting our wedding at Gruene Estate,
                New Braunfels,
                Texas. It has more than enough accommodation onsite to cover the guest numbers invited. It offers rooms,
                apartments and glamping options which are all ground level access. All events will take place at the
                same venue just in different parts of the estate. We understand not all guests may want to stay onsite
                and have listed local accommodation within walking distance of no more than 5 mins. Below you will find
                details including a map, accommodation and FAQs.</p>

                We plan to put more of our budget towards the entertainment and
                catering so have only booked a photographer for the ceremony and an
                hour of photos. We would ge grateful if you could share and tag photos
                and memories using the <strong>#evanandannamemories</strong> as we
                would love to create a documentary style digital and coffee book with
                these. You can follow our journey, inspirations and keep in touch
