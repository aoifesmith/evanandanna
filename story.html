            <p>
              Originally from Milan in Italy it's true I a proper Italian pizza
              and my Vespa! I'm not afraid to admit I am a romantic at heart.
              How could I not be with having met my soul mate so early on! I'm
              not a fan of extreme sports but have succumbed to the odd outing
              dipping my toes in the beginner’s area rapids for black water
              rafting. To be honest a nice shot of espresso and some knitting
              needles are my thing and proud of it. Just like mama!

            <h2>About Anna</h2>
            <p>
              For those of you who don't know me I'm the old cliché who has been
              dreaming of getting married for as long as I remember. You could
              often find me in my mother's room trying on her pretty necklaces.
              While I am a true romantic some may be surprised to know I have a
              penchant for skydiving, extreme back water rafting and deep sea
              exploration. I've travelled to 6 continents and have the
              Antarctica in my sights!

      <h2>How we met</h2>

      <p>
        When we were 17 a group of friends were going to an evening Kayaking
        class to see the night plankton light up the local lake. That weekend
        Anna, new to the group, staying at a mutual friend’s house didn’t know
        anyone except Lizzie. The group split up into different cars to get to
        the lake and we ended up in a car together. On the way the car broke
        down as it had run out of gas so Lizzie and the driver went to get some
        at a nearby station. It started to pour down rain really heavily and so
        they sheltered at the station waiting for it to move on. In that time we
        swapped stories and laughed for what seemed like hours. We got home and
        watched movies with some hot cocoa and continued swapping stories and
        watching movies for 12 more years.

        It was a day like any other but us. It started off normal with Anna off
        to work to one of her companies photoshoots which I was to collect her
        from when done. That particular day the company was preparing a product
        launch for a water bottle company. As part of the shoot there was a
        scroll of paper rolled up and placed in the glass bottle. Anna was in
        charge of setting up the display area which included her arranging the
        bottle with a ring in a box next to it. She had no idea she was holding
        her soon to be engagement ring. Anna felt the styling was perfect, but
        the photographer, who was shooting from a distance, insisted that the
        paper in the glass was distracting and producing a glare, making it
        difficult to capture.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Time went on and the sun was about to set. I had arrived at this stage
        very nervous of course. The photographer who was of course in on it
        pretended he was getting hoarse from shouting across said he would send
        me other with a final instruction as he was losing light. I told her he
        asked her to remove the message and see if there was an ink splatter or
        something on the paper that was causing the distraction. She diligently
        took the paper out and suddenly the penny dropped as she looked down to
        me kneeling on one knee. She gasped.. I trembled… she cried and said YES
        and we danced into the night. It was truly a magical evening.
